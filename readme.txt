To install, place the files included in the .zip into your WordPress plugin folder (that is /wp-content/plugins/). Now, go to your WordPress blog admin dashboard and enable the plugin. Finally, go to the options - myPh3 page to set the your gallery details.

In a WordPress post, you can type [preview]<photo_thumb_url>[/preview] to include a thumnail and full size photo. <photo_thumb_url> needs to be replaced here by the full URL of one of your album image thumbnails.
