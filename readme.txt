A WordPress plugin to include a myPh3 album image into your posts or pages

== Description ==

A WordPress plugin to include a myPh3 album image into your posts or pages. It makes it very easy to insert photo thumbnails just like myPh3 works.

== Installation ==

To install, place the files included in the .zip into your WordPress plugin folder (that is /wp-content/plugins/). Now, go to your WordPress blog admin dashboard and enable the plugin. Finally, go to the options - myPh3 page to set the your gallery details.

In a WordPress post, you can type [preview]<photo_thumb_url>[/preview] to include a thumnail and full size photo. <photo_thumb_url> needs to be replaced here by the full URL of one of your album image thumbnails.

== Changes ==

1.1 changes:
- Now, both the thumb and full image links can be used to put between [preview] tags
- Fixed bug no showing the full image in later posts
- Less error sensitive
